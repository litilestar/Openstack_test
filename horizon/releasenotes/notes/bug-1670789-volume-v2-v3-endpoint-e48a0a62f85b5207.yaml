    Previously horizon assumes only ``volume`` as an endpoint for the Cinder
    regardless of the API version. As a result, if deployers configure
    Cinder v2/v3 API endpoint as ``volumev2`` or ``volumev3``, Volume related
    menus -- "Create Volume from instance snapshot" and "Create instance from
    Volume" -- were not displayed. Horizon now checks the availability of the
    Block Storage service by looking for all posible endpoints ``volume``,
    ``volumev2`` and ``volumev3``.

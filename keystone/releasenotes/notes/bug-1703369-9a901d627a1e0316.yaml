    [`bug 1703369 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1703369>`_]
    There was a typo for the identity:get_identity_provider rule in the
    default ``policy.json`` file in previous releases. The default value for
    that rule was the same as the default value for the default rule
    (restricted to admin) so this typo was not readily apparent. Anyone
    customizing this rule should review their settings and confirm that
    they did not copy that typo. More context regarding the purpose of this
    backport can be found in the bug report.
